1834	52	52:5	this is what they told me: it heats up, and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops, and simply categorize them as portables.

1837	52	52:8	so you might ask, what did apple do for me?					
1838	52	52:9	for my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin (it happened 7 months ago) they offered me an itouch 8gig (you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich, offer a loyal customer like me, a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this).		company#general	company	general	negative
